# Array vs Linked list

Arrays and Linked lists have different time complexities for operations.

|           | Array | Linked List   |
| --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Reading   | O(1)  | O(n)          |
| Insertion | O(n)  | O(1)          |
| Deletion  | O(n)  | O(1)          |

### Types of Linked lists
In **Singly linked list** the first element points to the second, the second to the third, and so on.

In **Doubly linked list** not only does the first element points to the second, but the second also points to the first.

In **Circular Linked List** the first element is linked with the last.
