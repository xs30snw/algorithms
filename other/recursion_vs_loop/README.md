# Recursion vs Loop

Using loops might be better for performance, Recursion shows the solution more clearly.

Recursion is in preference when dealing with recursive data structures (e.g. a file tree with directories inside of other directories).

Recursive function has one or more *base cases,* and one or more *recursive cases.*
